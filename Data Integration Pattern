Data integration patterns: 

Federation: 

This pattern involves creating a virtual database that integrates data from multiple sources without moving the data.
It allows users to query and manipulate  data as if it were in a single database1.

Broadcast: 

Also known as "one-way sync from one to many," this pattern involves moving data from a single source to multiple destination systems in real-time or near real-time. 
It ensures that data is consistently updated across all systems2.

Consolidation:

This pattern involves combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified repository.
It is often used for data warehousing, where data from various systems is aggregated for analysis and reporting1.

Correlation:

This pattern identifies the intersection of two data sets and performs bi-directional synchronization only for the items that exist in both systems. 
It ensures that data is consistent and up-to-date across systems2.
